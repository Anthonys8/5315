      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
        <p>
        Docker is a tool that provides container software that helps developers to create, deploy and run application. By the help of container to package libraries and other dependencies, developers don't need to worry about which Operating System the application will run on because container will help to ship all the packages needed for the application to be running.<br /><br />

      <h2>What is Nginx</h2>
        <p>
        Nginx is a software that can be used for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, and more. When we make a request/visit to a page or a file, Nginx could take this request, then could either return a cached copy (if the cache hasn't expired), and/or distribute multiple requests to available servers to handle these requests. That said, Nginx is used to improve performance and will benefit both the content owner as well as the visitors. As content owners, Nginx could help us distribute network traffic across multiple servers to ensure there is no one server that works significantly harder that the others, and as visitors, since pages with Nginx server are optimized so that the loading time is minimized, we could be sure that we don't have to wait a long time for a request to be processed. In addiiton to this basic functionality, Nginx could also handle SSL/TLS connection and is highly configurable, hence why a lot of the most popular sites (including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Intel, Apple, and many more) nowadays use Nginx.<br /><br />

      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)</h2>
        <p>
          Virtual Machine is a software program that can be run on top of any Operating System. It can run on your local physical computer (host OS) like an application or program that you normally run as a guest OS. It can also be run on a different OS (for example running Windows virtual machine on Mac desktop). VM can be used to test out OS other than the one you have, to run an application that only run on specific OS (playing Windows game on your Mac computer), or to test out applications.<br /><br />

      <h2>Who is Cloud Computing Service Provider - DigitalOcean</h2>
        <p>
          DigitalOcean is one of the most popular Cloud Computing Service Provider, competing against AWS, Google Compute Engine and Microsoft Azure. DigitalOcean allows the users to launch Virtual Machine/servers, pick preferred number of processing units and storage limit, get dedicated servers which means that the users will not share the server with other users, and choose the geographical region and data center in specific regions or countries. There are also some Linux OS available that the users can choose from. DigitalOcean pricing can be considered as the cheapest, starting from $5/month.
